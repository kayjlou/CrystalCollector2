//2 options: have buttons static on page in HTML with on click events or dynamically create buttons

//define variables
//wins
//losses
//goalNum= randomnumberfunction()

//Generate random numbers (for goalNum & crystals)
//USE Math.floor(Math.random()) -- don't forget max/min

//after numbers are randomly generated update HTML to show goalNum

//Function to update total (this function will be called when buttons are clicked on page)
//Will look like  total = total + (crystal random number)
//Update HTML to show crystal

//Function to check if win or lose
//Check if total===goalNum (if so increment wins, if not increment losses)
//Update HTML to either wins or losses

//Click events for each button
//This function will run the updateTotal function based on which button is clicked

//Reset Function
//Reset variables (goalNum) (Could keep wins and losses if you want them incremented up to a certain number)
//Get random numbers again

//These are just function declarations I pseudo-coded -- Make sure to call the functions in the order you want to use them
//Results are endless :) Hope this helps!
